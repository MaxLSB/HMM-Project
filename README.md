With 2 other student from TÃ©lecom SudParis, we developed an algorithm for differentiating and accurately estimating the sources of emissions generated by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Gaussian mixtures through the study of scientific articles.

- Iterative Conditional Estimator (ICE)
- Forward-Backward Algorithm
- Simulations and Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning

The Final Report is in french though.
